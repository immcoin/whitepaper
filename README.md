#### What is an online education system?

Over the years, with incredible technological advancement, learning has moved out of the walls of class rooms and have entered into the virtual world, where there is no limit to knowledge. The Internet helped in developing virtual classes, were geographic boundaries were overthrown to gain knowledge from every corner of the world and was made available to everyone. 

*“CSCL or computer-based collaborative learning is the most innovative form of e-learning that can pave the way for a redefined online education system. On merging TEL, i.e., Technology Enhanced Learning with CBL and CBT a coherent merger of efficiency and effectiveness can be attained” -Proposed by An International Journal, on Science and Technology.*


The concept of virtual classes and e-learning is now seen in almost every educational institution. Students, management, and corporations are benefiting with this idea at large. Online learning and e-classes have now become the pivot of learning and development, especially in corporate and business development studies, management training and learning and development framework.

Indeed online education is the present and future of learning that promotes the power of knowledge and supremacy of intellection abilities to learning and development as a whole.

#### Learning and Development Through Online Education System

It is now an acceptable notion that people working in corporate will be provided training and learning programs to develop their managerial and performance skills. This being a prime notion has widely been accepted as a crucial investment in employee development by companies. Today management spends a great deal of their employee learning and development through specialized training programs, certifications, consortiums and more. 

The present-day learning and development take place through real face to face conferences, seminars and training programs conducted in a day or a couple of days at some conference hall, or hotel auditorium, which requires a lot of investing from company’s end. If only, we could change this face on interactions with the physical presence in real-time virtual interactive classes with the help of online education system, management can save a lot of their expenditure. 

Indeed, this change is very much needed and must be embraced for more convenient and economic L&D programs that pave the way for a brighter tomorrow.

#### Lags in Present Online Education System 

It’s time to change for good!

Yes, change is never easy, but when it comes to change in education system, it is something we all must evolve to accept. Over time, it is realized that people are facing very tough time imparting training and education through online courses, the major challenge is the structure itself. 

It’s not about how many people are attending such programs but the way they are conducted. And probably it’s time we bring about this change. Here are things that (through studies and survey that we conduct )seemed so prominent that will improve the online education and training system:

>**1. Presentation of courses:** most of the time the online learning takes place through power point presentation, with a dull slide show and even boring explanation. This being the prime cause of students, webinar and councilor are exiting the course halfway or not interested in taking up the class. 

>**2. Upto date syllabus/topics:** what is more important in online education format is to provide subjects relevant to present scenarios. Theories and business management can be learned through convention methods. But what’s trending should be focused upon to gain the attention of the learners. 

>**3. Flexibility in learning:**  training programs and leanings classes are conducted in a meeting hall within a specified time, posing a big contains to attendees spread geographically. Flexibility is vital to enable learning at own pace, which is the best method to inculcate personal development.

>**4. Precise and Collaborative learning:** what has been missing all this while, is discussion relevant to the topic and concentration on the issue itself. Learning with a team focused on a single notion adds to the productivity.

Innovation is the key to development. It’s time we innovate present online education system to incorporate changes that are acceptable and long-lasting. In regard, taking care of the future of online education system, it is impending to make changes that can contribute towards the learner’s development and at the same time improve the learning experience.

#### Future of Online education system 

*Growth of online education at a glance:*

According to a study conducted by the “futurethink” New York:
* There will be about 74% increase in learning and development through online models.
* Online education system will grow @60% with eLearning (62%), webinars (55%) and collaborative training (62%) .
* Along with this almost 100% agreed that online education system with the structured time frame of a micro module is the absolute future.

Taking this into account, it is vital for the promotion of an education system that is both structurally innovative and practically acceptable by all.

Specially designed and well-integrated online education system for the webinar, seminars/conferences, in-person workshops, monitoring programs and much more. These are the future of online education system that is most desirous of all. 

**The future of online education we want to cultivate:**

We are looking forward to developing specialized learning programs for webinars, corporate and management that will be conducted from our studios just like a live training session. 

**What will this imply?**
It implies that the basic concept of learning and development will be reformed to include:

1. Training through live interactive sessions
2. Conferences and seminars by distinguished management personnel and lecturers from across the globe (without having to travel anywhere)
3. Live learning and training assemblies can be joined from any part of the world through internet
4. 24x7, availability of our studios to conduct classes and courses
5. Economical and time-saving

We have been taught time and work management to improve efficiency and effectiveness of deliverables, and this change will bring about both. Using our extensive, well-equipped studios, management courses, training sessions, conferences, and courses can be conducted to train number of people from different parts of country/world at the same time.

The cost will be cut down to almost half, and strength of persons attending will be doubled which is going to affect the productivity and future of online education system in a positive manner.

#### Our Mission

“We are initiating a unique concept that is going to revolutionize online education system and is going to become the trend in future. The launch of ICO based on blockchain in an online education system that surpasses excellence in all regards. A system that is easy to incorporate, understand and benefit from- The future of online education system”.

We are pioneering a change in the online education system that covers the present system lags and merges them with the concept of microlearning programs, concentrating on the webinar, corporate learning, and development, business studies, in-person workshops, management seminars/consortium, etc. 

Our motto is simple; we want to bring a positive change in the online education system that is new, improved and futuristic. With our studio's online classes will be conducted and every inflow and outflow of information in any regard will become a part of blockchain data. The data stored in our blockchain database will be accessible to all our users who can identify the origin and sources through which such information or subject material originally descended.

The blockchain in education that we are propagating will uphold the quality of subject matter, authenticate movement of knowledgeable material, guarantee learning, and promise quality. 

Yes, this is the future!

#### Introduction to Blockchain

Before we make you understand our concept of blockchain online education system, it is paramount to understand the fundamental nature of blockchain and how we are merging it with the present online education system, to produce what we promise.

*Blockchain* typically is the concept of storing information in the form of blocks that are sealed through cryptography to prevent loss of data or editing its origin. A blockchain is so defined that it cannot be changed and each blockchain origin can easily be traced using the hash pointer allocated to respective blocks.

This concept of blockchain is extensively used for maintenance of records in cryptocurrency transaction called the ledger. Using the ledger any trade can be traced back to the point from where it originated. Thus, securing the genuineness of the transaction and maintaining its authenticity.

Benefits of using blockchain system

Why we want to implement the concept of blockchain will be clear which these benefits one can derive from it:

>**1. Transparency**
Blockchain system promotes transparency of movement and data. Since each movement in the blockchain is backed by the details of the previous link, users can quickly identify its origin.

>**2. Trusted**
Any transaction or document backed by blockchain is authentic and guaranteed through its cryptographic signature. Then it ensures users of geniuses gaining their trust and confidence.

>**3. Empowerment**
The sheer trust engraved with the use of blockchain empowers users as they are in charge of what information they are sharing

>**4. Reliable and Durable** 
As each transaction is secured with encryption, it brings about the reliability of data and user using the data, which adds to the life of such information making it last longer.

#### Blockchain in Education System and How We Propose Such a Change

*“Uniquely defining innovation in online education system”*

IMM plans to provide online education through its studios. We shall conduct virtual classes, lectures, and seminars from our studio live. This will allow real-time interactive session where users can directly question the presenter and get immediate answers; paving the way for an opportunity for an interactive, real-time virtual learning program that you can rely upon. 

The use of blockchain in education system that we believe will reinvent the online education system will be implemented in two stages:

>**1. Blockchain in authenticating documents**
The Internet is flooded with learning materials from all subject matters but with either no source link or very little information about its origin; thus, leaving the users of such information doubting the quality of content and information so provided. When each learning document becomes a valid part of a blockchain it will not only authenticate the content of such a learning material; it will allow users to trace its origin to know its source. The sheer exposure to malicious content and untraceable information will be reduced to minimum. Courses we will offer will be given to these authentic study materials, and learners can easily trace the source document through its blockchain signature.

>**2. Blockchain in payment using IMM coins**
Proposed is the use of IMM coins for payment of undertaking online classes. One of our already existing venture IMM traders deals in cryptocurrency transactions. Management's, offices or webinars willing to take up our classes can easily make payment through IMM coins. Since each IMM coin is backed by a blockchain, its source can easily be traced to ensure authenticity of payment. Even people taking up our online classes from any part of the world will have the convenience of paying through a single cryptocurrency, thereby elimination currency gaps.
